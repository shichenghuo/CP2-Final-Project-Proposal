# CP2-FinalProject-Proposal

### Summary

The project connects to the "Tetris Matching" project from CSP class. This project is about implementing interactable interfaces with HTML/CSS. I will make the opening pages, a tutorial for the game, and a game page. The goal is to allow users to interact, the interface has been designed and understandable for users in each step in order to give users a complete experience.

### Components
- Visual elements made with vector
- Input(keyboard/mouse click)
- Output(Visulized/responsive feedback on the page)

### Deconstructions/System Diagram
